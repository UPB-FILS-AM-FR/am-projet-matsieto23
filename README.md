## Description  Conducting a temperature detector helps to measure and monitor temperature variations in various environments, thus providing a wide range of practical applications.


## Motivation I chose this project because it was clearer for me to carry it out

## Architecture  Connecting the temperature sensor to Arduino:
- We plug in the temperature sensor to the appropriate pins of the Arduino according to the wiring diagram provided with the sensor.
- We make sure connections are secure and sensor is properly powered.

2. Arduino Programming:
- We use the IDE to write and upload the code to the digital Arduino card .
- We use appropriate libraries to interact with the temperature sensor and display values on the LCD screen (if used).
- arduino programming to read temperature sensor data at regular intervals and display or store them according to project needs.

3. Testing and Adjusting:
- We test the operation of the temperature detector by exposing the sensor at different temperatures and checking the values displayed or stored.
- If necessary, we adjust the code to improve accuracy or add additional features.

Possible applications:
- Temperature monitoring in agricultural greenhouses.
- Climate control in heating and air conditioning systems.
- Tracking environmental conditions in laboratories or warehouses.
- Integration in domotic projects for energy management etc.
